# openapi-preprocessor

`openapi-preprocessor` is an authoring tool to ease writing API documentation following OpenAPI 2.0/3.x specifications.

## Features
- Every valid OpenAPI 2.0 specification is a valid input (so you can easily start refactoring gradually from an existing spec)
- Allows to build a spec from multiple files; produces a single output file
- YAML or JSON input: YAML allows 
- Produces an OpenAPI with maximum compatibility with consumming tools:
  - simplifies complex parts of the spec
  - JSON output
  - remove 
- Add a few keywords (`$inline`, `$merge`) that allow to avoid duplication of content and ease the writing of consistent documentation
- (*TODO*) Unused global schemas (under `/definitions`), parameters (under `/parameters`) and responses (under `/responses`) are cleaned.

## Keywords

### `$ref`

    { "$ref": "<file>" }
    { "$ref": "<file>#<pointer>" }
    { "$ref": "#<pointer>" }

`$ref` is like in OpenAPI, but it can reference content in external files using relative URLs as well as intra-document. The referenced part of the pointed document is injected into the output document.

Restriction: JSON pointer location in the output document will be the same location as in the ref link. Example: `{"$ref": "external.yml#/parameters/Id"}` will import the content at `/parameters/Id`). This implies that partial files should have the same layout as a full spec (this is a feature as it enforces readability of partials).

### `$inline`

    { "$inline": "<file>#<pointer>"}

    {
        "$inline": "<file>#<pointer>",
        "pointer": <value>, // Overrides value at <file>#<pointer>/pointer1
        "pointer/slash": <value> // Overrides value at <file>#<pointer>/pointer/slash
    }

`$inline` is an OpenAPI extension allowing to inject a copy of another part of a document in place. Keys along the `$inline` keyword are JSON pointers (with the leading `/` removed) allowing to override some parts of the inlined content.

### `$merge`

    {
        "$merge": "<file>#<pointer>",
        "key": <value>,
        "key/slash": <value> // Overrides value at <file>#<pointer>/key~1slash
    }

    {
        "$merge": [
            "<file1>#<pointer1>",
            "<file2>#<pointer2>" // Overrides keys from <file1>#<pointer1>
        ]
        "key": <value>,
        "key/slash": <value> // Overrides value at <file2>#<pointer2>/key~1slash
    }


`$merge` is an OpenAPI extension allowing to copy a node, overriding some keys. This is a kind of inlined *`$ref` with keys overrides*.
